My personal web page<br>
Finally getting around to starting my own personal web page<br>

## Page Philosophy
I will use this page to learn and showcase my natual web development skills.  I plan to build this site with the following rules:
* No Frameworks
	* Although frameworks can help speed up the build process and make this page look a lot better I plan on attempting to build this page from scratch
* Public
	* Everything I do for this page will be publicly available via GitHub
* Do a bit each day
  * Even if it is just updating the Readme file, every bit counts
